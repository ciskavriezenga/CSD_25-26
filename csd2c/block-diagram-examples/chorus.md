"Chorus can be implemented by adding the original signal to a frequency-modulated delayed signal. The signal is typically delayed between 20 and 30 msec. Gain is applied to control the amount of mix between the original signal and the delayed signal. Common waveforms used to modulate the signal are sine, triangle and logarithmic waves."
"A stereo chorus effect ... can be created by having two choruses one quarter cycle out of phase with each other and sending the output of each to a sepearte channel ... ."
