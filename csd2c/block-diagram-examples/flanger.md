"Flanging was originally produced by taking two tapes with the same music on them and playing them at the same time. By pushing on the flanges of one of the tape reels, the playback speed of one of the copies of the sound was modulated. This detuning of the signal results in areas of constructive and destructive interference as the different frequencies moved in and out of phase with each other. This produced notches in the audio spectrum. As the frequency of the modulated signal was swept back and forth, these notches moved closer together and farther apart producing the characteristic "jet airplane" effect."

"Typical delay times are 10msec."

"A stereo flanger can be implemented by running two flangers at one quarter cycle out of phase from each other and sending each to a separate channel."
